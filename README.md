======

Create an Angular front end that uses the MMM library you created in the first half of the coruse. It should read the set of numbers in from a form and output them to the screen when a button labeled "calculate" is clicked.  Do the calculation on the server side and serve it up as a JSON end point.  Bonus Points: recalculate as new numbers are added instead of when "calculate" is clicked.  - You only need tests for the server side but jshint and jscs ALL of your code.  - Submit a link to the PR  - Along with any comments/thoughts/concerns
